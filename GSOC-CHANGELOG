-------------------------------------------------------CHANGELOG----------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Features:

-The LP solving is done regarding the multi-quant-conjunctive case
	-The LP deviates from paper CKK15 in equation 1, where y_s,N is ignored if s is not in a MEC.
	-Further the LP deviates a little, because the y_{s,N} are named z in the source code to not confuse them with y_{a},
	- y_{a} are referred as y_{s,a}, because it works better with the data-structures

-expanded Strategy for full support of multi-quant-conjunctive
	-done by one Overall-strategy, having the recurrent-strategies [which are objects] as attributes
	-recurrent-strategies: epsilon-approximations according to Claim 10 and its proof (for epsilon is between 10^-6 and 10^-9,
		for very ill-conditioned LPs this may vary, note that the rounding error toleration of PRISM is at 10^-12)
	-in a previous version: the "normal" strategies were used, but they were not readable enough to be outputted and they converged
		extremely slowly; therefore we currently use them as an in-between-step during the strategy-construction (with a
		reduced set of functionality)
	-the probability for switching from transient to recurrent is in contrast to Claim 13 of CKK15 normalised in a way that
		the probabilities of switch to a xi_N in an MEC m are summing up to 1

-Strategies can be inspected with the simulator-environment on the GUI, but the strategy is only visible and the simulation does not (yet)
	behave according to the strategy

-buildProduct:
	- returns a DTMC (in contrast to previous implementation returning an MDP)
	- This DTMC is wrapped up such that it fullfills the necessary interface such that we can operate it in MultiLongRun and verify it
	- 







Technical impovements:

-made/kept the distance between Multigain and PRISM as short as possible
-some test-cases in prism/test/testInputs (especially regarding CKK15-examples)



Code Style improvements:

-junit-Tests are added, when it was handy to me (approx. 5-10 at the moment)
-MultiLongRun was refactored during the expanding [not completely done, esp. regarding doc and slightly overloaded public interface]
	-naming of variables was improved when necessary
	-instead of parametrising methods with indices, we parametrised them with objects (in the MultiLongRun-environment)
	-Multi-Constraints (e.g. R{...}max=?, R{...}>=0.5, P>=0.5 [R{...} >= 0.5]) are now modelled by subclasses,
		which is a bit more clean than the old approach to set unused attributes to null, if they are not used
-dropped unused RandomNumberGenerator-class
-dropped superfluous methods in SimulatorEngine and Strategy
-Refactored MDPModelchecker: 
	-put checkMultiObjectives into ProbModelChecker (such that we can perform the satisfaction-tests also for some special DTMCs)
		TODO:can be generalised to all DTMCs 
	-removed memorylessness [now we have the general algorithm for multi-quant, therefore it would just increase the maintenance work
		to keep a special algorithm]

	dropped memorylessness, aka mlessmulti
